# DoubleRFs.jl

This is my personal tools for double RF.

You can clone this package, all in a directory called `DoubleRFs`, and add the root directory to `LOAD_PATH`.

For example:

```julia
push!(LOAD_PATH, "E:/Documents/JuliaProgram/MyModules/")
```
and the cloned `DoubleRFs` is child directory of `MyModules`.
